# discord_HangmanBot
Hangman Game
---------------

by Anish Natekar

To try the bot you will have to go to discord developer portal log in and create an new bot application.
from here you will get a link and a token for your bot.
then download this code and switch you token in the last line of code inside the quotations marks.
you can now add your bot to a server and run the code.
Type '.hangman' in a server channel to see how to play.
please support this project by sharing some ideas or getting in contact with me.
